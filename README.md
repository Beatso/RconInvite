# RconInvite
Add and remove users to your Minecraft whitelist from your discord server

# Setup
1. **Download newest version of [RconInvite]()** - Save the jar in any folder on your computer or your server. It's **recommend** to run this jar on a linux computer. On windows you have to create a start.bat and launch the bot. **NOTE:** The first time you start the jar it will close automaticly after creating all files.

2. **Before you restart the bot again** - Get your Discord Bot Token [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and insert it into `token` @ config.json. Running the Bot requires your servers IP, RCON Port and RCON Password. Get them from your server and fill it into `hostIp`, `rconPort` and `rconPw`. Save the file.

3. **Start your bot** - The Bot is ready to use. Launch it and try it yourself. Use `/addme <MC-User>` to add an user to the whitelist and `remove <MC-User>` to remove an user from the whitelist
